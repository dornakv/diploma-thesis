\chapter{Image Data Transformation}

We can attempt to classify the raw image data where the image is represented as a vector of light intensities at each pixel. However, it might be beneficial to transform the image data into a feature space using a feature extraction technique. The feature extraction techniques can be split into two categories: local feature extractors and global feature extractors\cite{lee2005}.

Local feature extractors localize such points in an image, which could be found regardless of the image subject position. These points are called key-points. The area around such key-points is then described using a vector called a descriptor. The descriptors are created in a way, which allows for matching similar features.

Global feature extractors transform the whole image into a lower-dimensional vector, attempting to retain the most important information.

For feature extraction, we compare three local feature extractors: SIFT, SURF and ORB, and a global feature extractor: PCA.

In this section, we describe the four feature extraction algorithms.
