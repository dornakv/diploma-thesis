\section{PCA}
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a global feature extractor. It is used to reduce the dimension of data while preserving as much of the data variance as possible.

The goal of PCA is to find an optimal projection from the original data point into a smaller vector space for each datapoint in data matrix.

Let $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a data point, where $t=1,\dots,T$ and $T$ is the amount of data points. We want to project $x_t$ into a $y_t \in \mathbb{R}^k$, where $k < n. Therefore, we need to find a mapping $\psi^{*}: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^l$
